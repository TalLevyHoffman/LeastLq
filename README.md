# LqSolver

**LqSolver** is a Python class designed to solve the \(\ell_q\)-norm regression problem of the form:

$$
\min_{\mathbf{x}} \|\mathbf{A}\mathbf{x} - \mathbf{b}\|_{q},
$$

where \(\|\cdot\|_q\) denotes the \(\ell_q\)-norm. The solver can handle different values of \(q\) (e.g., 1.1, 1.4, 1.7, etc.) to perform robust regression with respect to outliers and noise.

## Overview

- **What is \(\ell_q\) regression?**  
  \(\ell_q\) regression attempts to minimize the \(q\)-norm of residuals \(\|\mathbf{A}\mathbf{x} - \mathbf{b}\|_q\). This can be used to achieve robustness (for \(1 < q < 2\)) and to mitigate the effect of outliers in data.

- **Why use `LqSolver`?**  
  `LqSolver` provides a straightforward API for setting up and solving \(\ell_q\)-norm regression problems. It allows you to experiment with different \(q\) values to observe how robust regression might behave compared to, say, standard least-squares (\(\ell_2\)-norm) or \(\ell_1\)-norm solutions.

## Installation

1. **Clone or download this repository** (if not already part of your codebase).
2. **Install required dependencies** (e.g., NumPy). For example:
   ```bash
   pip install numpy
   ```
3. (Optional) If you want to integrate with your own environment, place the `LqSolver.py` file in your project directory or install it as a module using a local `setup.py`.

---

## Usage

### Importing the class

```python
from LqSolver import LqSolver
```

### Constructing the Solver

```python
import numpy as np

# Example matrix A (shape: n x p)
A = np.random.randn(100, 5)

# Example vector b (shape: n x 1)
b = np.random.randn(100, 1)

# Instantiate the solver
solver = LqSolver(A, b)
```

### Solving the Problem

```python
# Solve for a chosen q (e.g., 1.4) with a maximum number of iterations
x, r, info = solver.Solve(q=1.4, max_iters=80)
```

Here, the solver returns:
- `x` : the solution vector
- `r` : residuals or any relevant info (optional)
- `info` : additional convergence info (optional)

## API Reference

### `class LqSolver(A, b)`

**Constructor**  
```python
LqSolver(A, b)
```
- **Parameters**:
  - `A` *(np.ndarray)*: The coefficient matrix of shape `(n, p)`.
  - `b` *(np.ndarray)*: The target/observation vector of shape `(n, 1)` or `(n,)`.

- **Description**:  
  Stores the matrix \(\mathbf{A}\) and vector \(\mathbf{b}\) internally for the \(\ell_q\) regression problem.

---

### `LqSolver.Solve(q, max_iters=100, tol=1e-6, ...)`

**Parameters**:
- `q` *(float)*: The norm parameter \(q\). Typical values are in the range \((1, 2]\) or similar.  
- `max_iters` *(int, optional)*: Maximum number of iterations (default is 100).  
- `tol` *(float, optional)*: Tolerance for convergence (default is \(1\times10^{-6}\)).  
- *(Additional parameters may exist depending on the implementation, such as step sizes, regularization terms, etc.)*

**Returns**:
- `x` *(np.ndarray)*: The estimated \(\mathbf{x}\) that minimizes \(\|\mathbf{A}\mathbf{x} - \mathbf{b}\|_q\).  
- `residual` *(float or np.ndarray, optional)*: The final residual norm or any relevant info about the solution.  
- `info` *(dict, optional)*: A dictionary containing additional convergence information (iterations count, errors history, etc.).

**Description**:
Solves the regression problem:

$$
\min_{\mathbf{x}} \|\mathbf{A}\mathbf{x} - \mathbf{b}\|_q,
$$

using an iterative approach (for example, Iteratively Reweighted Least Squares (IRLS)) or another specialized method for \(\ell_q\)-type cost functions.

**Notes**:
- If `q=2`, it reduces to a standard least-squares problem.
- If `q=1`, it approximates an \(\ell_1\) (robust) regression.
- For values of `q` between 1 and 2, the solution can offer a trade-off between the robustness of \(\ell_1\) and the computational efficiency of \(\ell_2\).

## Examples

Below is a condensed version of typical usage:

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from LqSolver import LqSolver

# Generate synthetic data
n, p = 160, 5
A = np.random.randn(n, p) * 0.1
x_gt = np.random.randn(p, 1)
b_gt = A @ x_gt

# Add noise
noise_level = 40
noise = noise_level * np.linalg.norm(b_gt) / n / 10
b = b_gt + np.random.randn(n, 1) * noise

# Introduce outliers
outlier_ratio = 0.3
num_outliers = int(np.round(n * outlier_ratio))
indices = np.random.permutation(n)
b[indices[:num_outliers]] = np.random.rand(num_outliers, 1) * 2

# Solve with LqSolver for q=1.4
solver = LqSolver(A, b)
x_est, _, _ = solver.Solve(q=1.4, max_iters=80)

# Compute RMSE
rmse = np.sqrt(np.mean((x_gt - x_est)**2))

print("Estimated x:\n", x_est)
print("RMSE:", rmse)
```

## Implementation Details

`LqSolver` typically relies on an iterative algorithm (such as IRLS) to approximate the \(\ell_q\)-norm solution:

1. **Initialization**: Start from an initial guess \(\mathbf{x}^{(0)}\).  
2. **Reweighting**: At each iteration, reweight the residuals based on the current estimate \(\mathbf{x}^{(k)}\).  
3. **Update**: Solve a weighted least-squares problem to get \(\mathbf{x}^{(k+1)}\).  
4. **Convergence Check**: Stop if the change in \(\mathbf{x}^{(k)}\) or the change in the cost function is below `tol`, or if `max_iters` is reached.

**Complexity**: Each iteration often involves solving a least-squares subproblem. The computational cost is roughly \(O(n \cdot p^2)\) or \(O(n^2 \cdot p)\), depending on your solver and the structure of \(\mathbf{A}\).
